## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex
- Media queries for responsive webpage
- clamp() function for fluid typography
- Ordered and Unordered lists
- Table

### What I learned
When coding this project I realized that the first step to start a project is to make it responsive. Therefore before structuring and styling the content of the webpage, I first made it responsive to different screen size and added only the title of the webpage to judge how good the webpage will look on different screen sizes. Later on I structured the webpage and styled the contents. 
Other things that I learned was tables and list which I knew but implemented on a project for the first time.
Got to know how margin and padding works. Also learned how to color just the bullets or numbers in a list.

### Useful resource
- (https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - This helped me with calculations required for clamp() function.

- (https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to download different fonts for my webpage.
